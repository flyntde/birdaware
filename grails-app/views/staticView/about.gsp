  <h3>BirdAware.com</h3>
  The purpose of this site is to supplement the bird finding capabilities of eBird by accessing the recent observations records.  It is free for anyone who wishes to use it.
</p>
<p>
  BirdAware provides a few queries which are different than those found on eBird.org.  For example, this site provides queries to find all recent bird observations and all notable bird species occurring in any selected area in the world.  All of the bird sighting data is provided by eBird.org via their public web services <a href="https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/CLOISAPI/eBird+API+1.1">eBird API version 1.1</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Both reviewed and <em>Non-reviewed</em> records can retrieved which is was one of the main reasons to create this web site.  This means that sightings can be found as soon as they are submitted to eBird without waiting for the record to be reviewed by a human.  
</p>

<p>
  Feedback, questions, and suggestions are welcomed and graciously accepted.  Please send email to <em>info@birdaware.com</em>.

This site would not be possible without the extraordinary effort of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology and in particular the technical staff who have thoughtfully developed the eBird.org web application. Credit must also be given to all of the volunteer birding experts who selflessly maintain the integrity of the eBird data by reviewing observations submitted by birders.
</p>
<p>
During the development if this site it was realized and appreciated how much effort and thought must have gone into making the eBird system.  It is no small feat to collect and maintain this data; the web content they have created to display bird observations is remarkably rich yet simple to use.  Sincere appreciation and respect goes out to Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology and all those who have contributed to bringing online bird observations to the world.
